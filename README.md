# frontend-dev-codecademy
This folder contains some examples of the exercises completed in the frontend web development course in the Front-End Engineering course from codecademy.com, while some exercises are only available in the codecademy.com sandbox environment.
Projects included here cover simple HTML and CSS, after moving on to Javascript syntax, responsive and interactive web development, React, Redux, and Redux Toolkit.
Towards the end of the course, linear and complex data structures and algorithms were implemented in JS.
